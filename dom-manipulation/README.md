Welcome to my DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and JSON Data project.

In this project, I developed a dynamic web application that generates, manages, and filters content based on user interactions. I used advanced JavaScript techniques to manipulate the DOM, store data in the browser, and handle JSON.

What I Learned

- How to create and update dynamic content using JavaScript.
- How to use local storage and session storage to keep data even after the page reloads.
- How to import and export JSON data to manage the application's state.
- How to build a content filtering system based on user choices.
- How to sync local data with a server and handle any conflicts that arise.

Project Goals

By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Apply advanced DOM manipulation to make the app interactive.
- Use event-driven programming to respond to user actions.
 Work with web storage to save and retrieve data in the browser.
- Manage JSON data consistently across the application.
- Filter and display content dynamically.
- Sync browser-stored data with a server while ensuring data consistency.

Final Thoughts

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts. I can now create interactive and persistent web applications that offer a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Feel free to explore the code and leave feedback.
